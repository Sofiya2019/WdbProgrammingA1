<p> One of My Favorite Quotes by Dr. Seuss:</p>
<q>Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love the people who treat you right, forgive the ones who don't, and believe everything happens for a reason. 
If you get the chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. 
Nobody said it'd be easy, they just promised it would be worth it.</q>
